## Formats

* Texts are written in Markdown syntax and converted to HTML using [Discount](https://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) GFM (through [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com)).
* Images are done in Keynote. The script "convert.sh" uses [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) to convert/crop the Keynote-exported PNG files into the final PNG/GIF files.
