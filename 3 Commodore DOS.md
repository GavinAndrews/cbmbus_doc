# Commodore Peripheral Bus: Part 3: Commodore DOS

## layer 3 features relevant from a device's view

* a device has 32 channels
* a channel can be associated (and dissociated) with a name
* device can send byte streams from channels
* device can receive byte streams into channels

## disk drive overview

* one or more drives
	* one "unit", drives 0 and 1
* file types
	* SEQ/PRG/USR: sequential, only linear access, no random access (seeking)
	* REL: relative

<!--
* some drives:
	* subdirectories
	* partitions
	* burst commands
-->

## channel number overview

* channels 0-14 need to be associated with names
	* filenames
	* special names
* channel 15 is status
* channels 16-31 illegal

<!--
|      |                 |
|------|-----------------|
| 0    | implicit ,P,R   |
| 1    | implicit ,P,W   |
| 2-14 | files           |
| 15   | commands/status |
-->

## named channels

* channels 0-14 need to be associated with names

### regular files

* filenames don't contain
	* 0xA0
	* ","
* don't start with
	* "$"
	* "#"
	* "&"
* filename length not specified (usually 16)

* file access string:
	* ,P/S/U/L
	* ,P/S/U/L,R/W/A
	* 0/1: (drive select)
	* @: (overwrite)
		* ,W fails if file exists
	* wildcards
		* ?
		* `*`

### special files:
* "$"
	* $n for drive 0/1
	* $:abc*
	* link to post
* "#"
	* fn "#" or "#n", where n is the buffer number (0-4 on 1541)
	* command channel will return buffer number
* "&"

## command channel

* write: command
	* uppercase ASCII commands (= PETSCII)
	* terminated by CR or UNLISTEN :(

### Notes

* Data model first
* Then file names
* copy merge
* Wildcards
* Dup files diff types?
* S/R needs type?
