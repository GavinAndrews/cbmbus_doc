# Commodore Peripheral Bus: Part 3: Commodore DOS

## layer 3 features relevant from a device's view

* a device has 32 channels
* a channel can be associated (and dissociated) with a name
* device can send byte streams from channels
* device can receive byte streams into channels

-> description of common feature set of Commodore DOS; extensions at the end of the article

* in contrast to other articles of the series, this one is just an overview of the design
* respective manuals are good references
* *conceptual* 

## disk drive overview

* one or more drives
	* one "unit", one or more drives: 0, 1...
* disks
	* have a name
	* have an ID
	* support files
* file types
	* sequential
		* SEQ/PRG/USR
		* only linear access, no random access (seeking)
		* PRG is meant for executable files
		* USR is meant as an extension
		* both treated the same by DOS
		* at least 1 byte!
	* relative
		* REL
		* fixed record size
		* random access
	* not part of filename
		* can't have X,S and X,P on the same disk

## channel number overview

* channels 0-14 need to be associated with names
	* filenames
	* special names
* channel 15 is status
* channels 16-31 illegal

<!--
|      |                 |
|------|-----------------|
| 0    | implicit ,P,R   |
| 1    | implicit ,P,W   |
| 2-14 | files           |
| 15   | commands/status |
-->

## named channels

* channels 0-14 need to be associated with names

### regular files

* filenames don't contain
	* 0xA0 (PETSCII shifted Space)
	* ","
* don't start with
	* "$"
	* "#"
	* "&"
* filename length not specified (usually 16)

* file access string:
	* ,P/S/U/L
	* ,P/S/U/L,R/W/A
	* 0/1: (drive select)
	* @: (overwrite)
		* ,W fails if file exists
	* wildcards
		* ?
		* `*`

### special files:
* "$"
	* $n for drive 0/1
	* $:abc*
	* link to post
* "#"
	* fn "#" or "#n", where n is the buffer number (0-4 on 1541)
	* command channel will return buffer number
* "&"

## command channel

* write: command
	* uppercase ASCII commands (= PETSCII)
	* terminated by CR or UNLISTEN :(

* read: status
	* terminated by CR, will keep repeating
	* aa,sssss,bb,cc,d
	* with d:
		* 1001, 8050, 8250
	* without d:
		* 2031, all serial devices

### limitations

* 0 byte files don't exist
* all Commodore drives:
	* 0 and 1 byte files buggy
	* read back as 13 0 2 13
* CMD drives
	* 0 byte files will have single 13

### optional features

* consistent feature set on
	* all IEEE-488 drives (e.g. 2040 [1978], D9060/D9090 HD, SFD 1001 [1985])
	* 1540, 1541(-C, -II), 1551; 1541 clones
* later "Fast Serial" devices had additions

#### 1571

* burst commands

#### 1581

* partitions (`CBM`)

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| PARTITION      | `/`[_drv_][`:`_name_[`,`_track_ _sector_ _count_lo_ _count_hi_ `,C`]] | Select/create partition |

#### CMD
* CMD-style partitions
* subdirectories (`DIR`), CMD
* real-time clock
* lots of commands
