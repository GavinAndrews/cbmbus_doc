# Commodore Peripheral Bus: Part 1: IEEE-488

In the series about the variants of Commodore Peripheral Bus family, this article covers the lowest two layers of the IEEE-488 bus as found on the PET and the CBM-II series.

## History

Released in 1977, the PET was Commodore's first computer. For connecting floppy drives, hard drives, printers and plotters, the designers decided to go with an existing bus specification: The Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus ("HP-IB") from the late 1960s, which was later standardized as IEEE-488 in the USA and as IEC-625 internationally, which was already popular for test equipment, but also for printers. This article covers IEEE-488 from the PET's perspective. Differences to the standard are mentioned at the end.

IEEE-488 is a 8 bit parallel bus with the following properties:

* All participants are **daisy-chained**.
* **One dedicated controller** (the computer) does bus arbitration of **up to 31 devices**.
* **One-to-many**: Any participant can send data to any set of participants.
* A device has **multiple channels** for different functions.
* Data transmission is **byte stream** based.

## Electrical Layer

On the computer side, the PET uses a proprietary 24 pin board connector:

All devices use the standardized IEEE-488 connector, which is a 24 pin micro ribbon connector:

![](docs/cbmbus/micro_ribbon_24.svg =400x85)

Devices usually only have a single micro ribbon connector, but the connectors of common IEEE-488 cables have one male and one female side, so the back side of every cable connector becomes the connector to the next device.

The pinout is similar across the two connectors:

| Pin | Signal | Description        | Pin   | Signal | Description        |
|-----|--------|--------------------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| 1   | DIO1   | Data I/O           | 13/A  | DIO5   | Data I/O           |
| 2   | DIO2   | Data I/O           | 14/B  | DIO6   | Data I/O           |  
| 3   | DIO3   | Data I/O           | 15/C  | DIO7   | Data I/O           |
| 4   | DIO4   | Data I/O           | 16/D  | DIO8   | Data I/O           |
| 5   | EOI    | End Or Identify    | 17/E  | REN    | Remote Enable      |
| 6   | DAV    | Data Valid         | 18/F  | GND    |                    |
| 7   | NRFD   | Not Ready For Data | 19/H  | GND    |                    |
| 8   | NDAC   | No Data Accepted   | 20/J  | GND    |                    |
| 9   | IFC    | Interface Clear    | 21/K  | GND    |                    |
| 10  | SRQ    | Service Request    | 22/L  | GND    |                    |
| 11  | ATN    | Attention          | 23/M  | GND    |                    |
| 12  | SHIELD |                    | 24/N  | GND    |                    |     

Here's a rough overview of the purpose of the wires:

* The eight DIO lines carry the data bytes.
* The NRFD, DAV and NDAC lines are used to perform handshaking.
* EOI, ATN, SRC and REN are control lines.
* IFC is the RESET line for all devices.

<!--
* There are three more control lines:
	* EOI signals the end of a data stream.
	* ATN signals that the controller is sending bus arbitration commands.
	* SRQ signals that a device needs the controller's attention.
	* REN tells the devices that they are in remote control mode (always enabled on the PET).
	* IFC is the RESET line. It is connected to the computer's RESET line.
-->

All signal lines are TTL open collector, which means that they default to 5V, and can be "pulled" to 0V by any participant on the bus. So if one or more participants pull the line, it will be at 0V, otherwise it will be at 5V. The naming can be inconsistent and confusing, so here is an overview:

| Voltage | pulled?  | asserted?  | active?  | Logical |
|---------|----------|-----------------------|---------|
| 0V      | pulled   | asserted   | active   | 1       |
| 5V      | released | unasserted | inactive | 0       |

Note that 0V is logical 1 and 5V is logical 0. So a wire defaults to 0 and any participant can set it to 1.

It is important to understand that it is impossible to tell which participant pulled a line to 1, or whether it is one or more participants currently pulling it.

## Byte Transfer

* bus is byte oriented
* 8-bit parallel
	* 8 bit data DIO1-DIO8
* one sender
	* puts data on DIO and participates in handshake
* any number of receivers
	* read data off DIO and participate in handshake
* any number of passive devices
	* will leave everything alone
* send byte: three-wire-handshake
	* ownership
		* DIO1-8 and DAV is owned by the sender
		* NDAC and NRFD are owned by the receivers
		* lines that are not owned are released
	* initial state
		* sender releases DAV (data not available)
		* every receiver pulls NDAC (not all receivers have accepted the data)
		* every receiver pulls NRFD (not all receivers are ready for data)
	* as soon as a receiver is no longer busy
		* release NRFD (receiver is ready for data)
		* as soon as all receivers do this, NRFD is released
	* sender waits for NRFD to be released
	* sender puts inverted data byte on DIO
		* (inverted because pulled is logical 1)
	* sender pulls DAV (data is available)
	* receiver waits for DAV
	* receiver gets inverted data byte from DIO
	* receiver pulls NRFD (receiver is not ready for data)
		* this is the default state for a receiver so the sender doesn't continue
		  with the next byte until the receiver has done something with the data
	* receiver releases NDAC (receiver has accepted the data)
		* as soon as all receivers do this, NDAC is released
	* sender releases DAV (data is not available)
	* sender sets data to $00 (all DIO lines are released)
	* receiver waits for DAV to be released
	* receiver pulls NDAC (receiver has not accepted data)
	* we're in the original state again
* errors
	* device not present
		* if there is no receiver, NDAC *and* NRFD are released
			* this can be detected by sender at "start"
		* XXX if there is no sender?
			* can't be detected?
	* timeout (Commodore extension)
		* receiver timeout: if data not accepted within 64 us
		* sender timeout: if data not available within 64 us
		* for compatibility with IEEE, this can be disabled (SETTMO #$80)
* EOI
	* EOI pulled by sender while data is valid
* bus turnaround
	* sender becomes receiver (secondary after talk)
		* while ATN pulled
		* pull NRFD and NDAC
		* release ATN
	* receiver becomes sender
		* TODO
		

* comments:
	* no timing requirements!
	* slowest device defines speed
		* anyone can pause at any time
		* great for CPUs that have other things to do as well
		* IRQs remain on, NMIs and DMA okay
	* Commodore
		* timeouts, so it can detect that sender has no data
		* implicit communication through timing!

* Commodore
	* features not implemented on CBM devices
	    * multiple controllers
	    * SRQ
	    * polling
	    * etc.
	* PET has all lines (except REN), so a program can do real IEEE-488
	* BASIC doesn't have all features though
	    * SRQ
	    * REN
	    * 00xxxxx commands


* controller and command bytes
	* just this supports the use case of one device that is always the sender, and plus some devices which are only receivers
		* e.g with a computer and a printer or a disk copy station with one source and one or many destinations
	* one device needs to be the designated "controller"
	
	* controller can interrupt the bus at any time
	* sends one control byte
		* controller pulls ATN
		* controller sends 1 byte
		* *all* other devices receive control byte
		* controller releases ATN

* SRQ and REN
	* TODO
