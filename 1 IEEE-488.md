# Commodore Peripheral Bus: Part 1: IEEE-488

In the series about the variants of Commodore Peripheral Bus family, this article covers the lowest two layers of the IEEE-488 bus as found on the PET and the CBM-II series.

## History

Released in 1977, the PET was Commodore's first computer. For connecting floppy drives, hard drives, printers and plotters, the designers decided to go with an existing bus specification: The Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus ("HP-IB") from the late 1960s, which was later standardized as IEEE-488 in the USA and as IEC-625 internationally, which was already popular for test equipment, but also for printers. This article covers IEEE-488 from the PET's perspective. Differences to the standard are mentioned at the end.

IEEE-488 is a 8 bit parallel bus with the following properties:

* All participants are **daisy-chained**.
* **One dedicated controller** (the computer) does bus arbitration of **up to 31 devices**.
* **One-to-many**: Any participant can send data to any set of participants.
* A device has **multiple channels** for different functions.
* Data transmission is **byte stream** based.

## Electrical Layer

IEEE-488 uses a 24 pin micro ribbon connector:

On the computer side, the PET uses a proprietary 24 pin board connector:

The ordering in the pinout is the same across the two connectors:

| Pin | Signal | Description        | Pin   | Signal | Description        |
|-----|--------|--------------------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| 1   | DIO1   | Data I/O           | 13/A  | DIO5   | Data I/O           |
| 2   | DIO2   | Data I/O           | 14/B  | DIO6   | Data I/O           |  
| 3   | DIO3   | Data I/O           | 15/C  | DIO7   | Data I/O           |
| 4   | DIO4   | Data I/O           | 16/D  | DIO8   | Data I/O           |
| 5   | EOI    | End Or Identify    | 17/E  | REN    | Remote Enable      |
| 6   | DAV    | Data Valid         | 18/F  | GND    |                    |
| 7   | NRFD   | Not Ready For Data | 19/H  | GND    |                    |
| 8   | NDAC   | No Data Accepted   | 20/J  | GND    |                    |
| 9   | IFC    | Interface Clear    | 21/K  | GND    |                    |
| 10  | SRQ    | Service Request    | 22/L  | GND    |                    |
| 11  | ATN    | Attention          | 23/M  | GND    |                    |
| 12  | SHIELD |                    | 24/N  | GND    |                    |     

, with 16 wires carrying TTL signals:

Device usually only have a single micro ribbon connector, but the connectors of common IEEE-488 cables have one male and one female side, so the back side of every cable connector becomes the connector to the next device.

* Handshake
	* NRFD
	* DAV
	* NDAC
* Protocol
	* IFC (RESET)
	* ATN
	* SRQ
	* REN (remote enable, grounded on PET, i.e. active: all devices on the bus are remote-controller, i.e. controlled by the PET and actually listen to ATN commands, as opposed to local mode, in which they are controlled by front-panel controls)
	* EOI

* lots of GND pins
* IFC is RESET
* 8 data lines
* 7 signal lines
* all other lines are open collector https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector
	* defaults to 5V (line is "incative")
	* will be 0V if any device pulls it down
		* 0V = pulled down = asserted = active = 1
		* 5V = released = unasserted = inactive = 0
		* -> inverse logic
		* that's for signals (bits) as well as data
	* it's impossible to tell who pulls it down

## Byte Transfer

* bus is byte oriented
* 8-bit parallel
	* 8 bit data DIO1-DIO8
* one sender
	* puts data on DIO and participates in handshake
* any number of receivers
	* read data off DIO and participate in handshake
* any number of passive devices
	* will leave everything alone
* send byte: three-wire-handshake
	* ownership
		* DIO1-8 and DAV is owned by the sender
		* NDAC and NRFD are owned by the receivers
		* lines that are not owned are released
	* initial state
		* sender releases DAV (data not available)
		* every receiver pulls NDAC (not all receivers have accepted the data)
		* every receiver pulls NRFD (not all receivers are ready for data)
	* as soon as a receiver is no longer busy
		* release NRFD (receiver is ready for data)
		* as soon as all receivers do this, NRFD is released
	* sender waits for NRFD to be released
	* sender puts inverted data byte on DIO
		* (inverted because pulled is logical 1)
	* sender pulls DAV (data is available)
	* receiver waits for DAV
	* receiver gets inverted data byte from DIO
	* receiver pulls NRFD (receiver is not ready for data)
		* this is the default state for a receiver so the sender doesn't continue
		  with the next byte until the receiver has done something with the data
	* receiver releases NDAC (receiver has accepted the data)
		* as soon as all receivers do this, NDAC is released
	* sender releases DAV (data is not available)
	* sender sets data to $00 (all DIO lines are released)
	* receiver waits for DAV to be released
	* receiver pulls NDAC (receiver has not accepted data)
	* we're in the original state again
* errors
	* device not present
		* if there is no receiver, NDAC *and* NRFD are released
			* this can be detected by sender at "start"
		* XXX if there is no sender?
			* can't be detected?
	* timeout (Commodore extension)
		* receiver timeout: if data not accepted within 64 us
		* sender timeout: if data not available within 64 us
		* for compatibility with IEEE, this can be disabled (SETTMO #$80)
* EOI
	* EOI pulled by sender while data is valid
* bus turnaround
	* sender becomes receiver (secondary after talk)
		* while ATN pulled
		* pull NRFD and NDAC
		* release ATN
	* receiver becomes sender
		* TODO
		

* comments:
	* no timing requirements!
	* slowest device defines speed
		* anyone can pause at any time
		* great for CPUs that have other things to do as well
		* IRQs remain on, NMIs and DMA okay
	* Commodore
		* timeouts, so it can detect that sender has no data
		* implicit communication through timing!

![](docs/cbmbus/ieee-488.gif =601x577)

* Commodore
	* features not implemented on CBM devices
	    * multiple controllers
	    * SRQ
	    * polling
	    * etc.
	* PET has all lines (except REN), so a program can do real IEEE-488
	* BASIC doesn't have all features though
	    * SRQ
	    * REN
	    * 00xxxxx commands


* controller and command bytes
	* just this supports the use case of one device that is always the sender, and plus some devices which are only receivers
		* e.g with a computer and a printer or a disk copy station with one source and one or many destinations
	* one device needs to be the designated "controller"
	
	* controller can interrupt the bus at any time
	* sends one control byte
		* controller pulls ATN
		* controller sends 1 byte
		* *all* other devices receive control byte
		* controller releases ATN

* SRQ and REN
	* TODO
